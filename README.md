Sometimes you write a module that needs a config form that can accept 
any number of urls or any number of words or any number of numbers.
This module provides an easily extendable form base for such situations.
The example sub module, not surprisingly, contains an example of
an form that extends the SimpleInfiniteFormBase class.
