This module provides two very useful config form bases.
The example sub module, not surprisingly, contains examples
of how to use them.

1. SimpleInfiniteFormBase
Sometimes you write a module that needs a config form that can accept
any number of urls or any number of words or any number of numbers.
This module provides an easily extendable form base for such situations.

2. SuperInfiniteFormBase
If you want to be able to rearrange entires by dragging them or if you
need multiple inputs per config entry (a name and phone number, say), then
you can extend the SuperInfiniteFormBase.
